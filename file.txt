Your world is an ashtray, we burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry, your ashes turn to mud
The nature of the leeches, the virgin's feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of your life

My world is unaffected
There is an exit here, I say it is and it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead

I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When I'm God everyone dies
